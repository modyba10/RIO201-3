!!!! FIRST read everything then continue !!!

Copy all the files into
~/iot-lab/parts/contiki/examples/ipv6/http-server

Compile with the attached Makefile

Note!!
1. This file has a combined http-server / http-client. It is exclusively for comparison of HTTP and COAP.
2. If you overwrite the file, you will lose the old http-server, which may affect your other projects. Therefore, ALWAYS make a backup of your old file. 
3. To avoid overwriting your old files, I recommend that you create another backup environment of iot-lab, and install these files there. So you will have two environments and they will not collide with each other.
